# Puzzle Piece #
A puzzle game where you must match pieces of a puzzle together to form a square.  

## Overview ##

Each piece piece contains four numbers on it, either positive or negative.  The puzzle pieces
"fit" together when the numbers on the sides of the two pieces, when added together, equal zero.
So for example when a piece with a side of 3 is put against a piece with a side of -3, they fit.
However a side of 3 and a side of 2 would not fit together.  This same logic applies to all sides
of all pieces.
